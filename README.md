# hello-world
This is my first repository.

hello I'm Milo! Been learning how to code for about 2 weeks, my main goal is to first dominate Mexico networks to tackle down the narcos, then make a change for the best in the corrupt political system that we got, so we can reduce the wealth inequality gap that we have here.

nice to meet you! don't hesitate in contacting me, friend!
